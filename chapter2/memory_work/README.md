# How memory works

This is basically how your computer's memory works. Your computer looks like a giant set of drawers, and each drawer has an address.

**fe0ffeeb** is the address of a slot in memory

Each time you want to store an item in memory, you ask the computer for some space, and it gives you an address where you can store your item.
If you want to store multiple items, there are two basic ways to do so: **arrays** and **lists**.

There isn't one right way to store items for every use case.
