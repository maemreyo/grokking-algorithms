# Recap

- Your computer's memory is like a giant set of drawers.
- When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list.
- With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other.
- With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.
- Arrays allows fast reads.
- Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
- All elements in the array should be the same type (all integer, all doubles, ...).
