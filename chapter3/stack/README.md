# The stack

Stack has only two actions: push (insert) and pop (remove and read).

All functions calls go onto the call stack.

The call stack can get very large, which takes up a lot of memory.

# Recursion

Recursion is when a function calls itself.

Every recursive function has two cases: the base case and the recursive case.

- The recursive case is when the function calls itself.
- The base case is when the function doesn't call itself again :arrow_right: so it doesn't go into an infinite loop.
